/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset implements a strict, user-centric ownership model.
 * All data is sandboxed, meaning each authenticated user can only access and
 * manage their own information. There is no concept of public or shared data.
 *
 * Data Structure: All application data is nested under the `/users/{userId}` path.
 * The primary collection, `clientes`, exists as a subcollection for each user,
 * ensuring a clear and secure separation of data between different users.
 * The structure is `/users/{userId}/clientes/{clienteId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Default Deny: All operations are denied by default. Access is only granted
 *   through explicit `allow` statements.
 * - Strict Ownership: A user's identity (`request.auth.uid`) is verified
 *   against the `userId` parameter in the document path for every operation. This
 *   prevents any user from accessing another user's data.
 * - No User Listing: The top-level `/users` collection is not readable,
 *   preventing malicious actors from discovering the list of all application users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: This ruleset relies on Path-Based
 * Authorization. The `userId` in the path `/users/{userId}` is the sole source of
 * truth for ownership. This design is highly performant as it requires no
 * extra document reads (`get()` calls) to authorize an operation.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: The entire data model is built on segregation. Each
 * user's data is stored in its own document tree, making it impossible for list
 * queries to accidentally leak data from other users.
